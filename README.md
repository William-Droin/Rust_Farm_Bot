  Rust Farm Bot
  <br>
</h1>

A farming Bot for the survival game [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/)
The Bot is using machine learning and computer vision to recognise the ressources to gather.

## The Goals

- Train an Ai to accurately detect the ressources to gather
- Create a path finding Algorithm to enable the bot to walk in the game and gather the ressources.
- Organise a competition between the members of the community to design the best path finding algorithm.
